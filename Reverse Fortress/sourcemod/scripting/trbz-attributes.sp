/* *** Attributes In This Plugin ***
  !  "speed boost on hit teammate"
       "<user's speed boost duration> <teammate's>"
	   Upon hitting a teammate, both of your speeds will be boosted
	   for N seconds.
	   Can currently only be used on hitscan weapons and melee weapons,
	   due to TraceAttack not having a weapon parameter. :c
  -> "aim punch multiplier"
       "<multiplier>"
	   Upon hitting an enemy, the "aim punch" applied to their aim
	   will be multiplied by this amount.
	   High amounts are useful for disorienting enemies,
	   and low amounts will disable aim punch to prevent throwing off enemies.
  -> "aim punch to self"
       "<multiplier>"
	   Upon attacking with this weapon, the user will receive this much aim punch.
  -> "look down attack velocity"
       "<start velocity> <push velocity>"
	   When the user looks down and attacks with this weapon,
	   they will be pushed up into the air by N Hammer units.
	   "Start" value is for if the user is on the ground,
	   "push" is applied when they are already vertically moving.
  -> "add metal on attack"
       "<amount>"
	   Each time the user attacks with this weapon, they will gain this much metal.
	   You probably want to use a negative value with this attribute.
	   If negative, the user won't be able to fire this weapon unless they have
	   sufficient metal.
  -> "infinite ammo"
       "<ammo counter>"
	   This weapon's offhand ammo count will always be set to this amount.
	   If you're going to use this attribute, you also ought to add either
	   "hidden primary max ammo bonus" or "hidden secondary max ammo penalty" (TF2 attributes)
	   to your weapon, setting them to 0.0.
	   That way, the user cannot pick up and waste precious ammo packs and dropped weapons.
  -> "crits ignite"
	   Critical hits from this weapon will ignite the victim.
  -> "crit damage multiplier"
	   <multiplier>
	   Scales the amount of crit damage from this weapon.
	   The multiplier is applied to the base damage, so 1.5 on a sniper rifle headshot =
	   50 * 1.5 = 75, and 75 * 3 = 225.
  -> "old honorbound"
	   Works like honorbound used to. Can't switch from your weapon until you get a kill with it.
	   
	   ***trbz_ new attributes***
  -> "damage to cond"
	   <condition ID> <min duration> <duration per damage mult>
       Apply a condition to the victim on damage. Lasts for a minimum duration plus an extra amount
	   equal to a multiplier times the damage dealt.
	   e.g. "damage to cond" "32 1 0.01" will apply speed boost for 1 + 0.01(damage dealt) seconds.
	   NOTES:
	   - This does not stack across multiple hits, but rather resets when applied again
	   - This does not count critical damage (e.g. a headshot will apply same duration as bodyshot)
	   - Some multi-hits don't do the duration mult properly (e.g. for some reason, scatterguns halve it)
	   
*/

// Here's where we store attribute values, which are received when the attribute is applied.
// There's one for each of the 2048 (+1) edict slots, which will sometimes be weapons.
// For example, when "crit damage multiplier" "0.6" is set on a weapon, we want
// CritDamage[thatweaponindex] to be set to 0.6, so we know to multiply the crit damage by 0.6x.
